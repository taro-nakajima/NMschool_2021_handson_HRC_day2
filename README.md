When starting a neutron scattering experiment on a single crystal at HRC, we need to know the orientation of the crystal. We measure a neutron Laue diffraction pattern with a polychromatic neutron beam (without using the Fermi chopper). A typical neutron Laue diffraction pattern is shown below.

This is a diffraction pattern for a tetragonal crystal.
* Lattice constants : a = b = 8.499 A, c = 5.528 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 deg.
* Space group : P-42<sub>1</sub>m
* (Nominal) horizontal scattering plane : (H,0,L)

Let us determine the orientation of the crystal from this diffraction pattern by using a web application [Neutron Laue DIffraction Pattern Simulator for HRC(BL12)](https://nakajima.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tools/hrc_laue_sim/).

### Problem 1
In the latter part of this training, we will try data analysis of inelastic neutron scattering spectra of a 1D antiferromagnet CsVCl<sub>3</sub>. Before the inelastic part, let us try the alignment of the crystal.

* Preliminary info. on CsVCl<sub>3</sub>
        * Lattice constants : a = b = 7.23700 A, c = 6.02600 A, alpha = beta = 90 deg,  gamma = 120 deg.
        * Space group : P 6<sub>3</sub>/mmc
        * (Nominal) horizontal scattering plane : (H,0,L)
