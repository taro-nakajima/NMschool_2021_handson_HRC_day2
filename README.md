When starting a neutron scattering experiment on a single crystal at HRC, we need to know the orientation of the crystal. We measure a neutron Laue diffraction pattern with a polychromatic neutron beam (without using the Fermi chopper). A typical neutron Laue diffraction pattern is shown below.

This is a diffraction pattern for a tetragonal crystal.
* Lattice constants : a = b = 8.499 A, c = 5.528 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 deg.
* Space group : P-42<sub>1</sub>m
* (Nominal) horizontal scattering plane : (H,0,L)

Let us determine the orientation of the crystal from this diffraction pattern by using a web application [Neutron Laue DIffraction Pattern Simulator for HRC(BL12)](https://nakajima.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tools/hrc_laue_sim/).

### Problem 1
In the latter part of this training, we will try data analysis of inelastic neutron scattering spectra of a 1D antiferromagnet CsVCl<sub>3</sub>. Before the inelastic part, let us try the alignment of the crystal.

* Preliminary info. on CsVCl<sub>3</sub>
    * Lattice constants : a = b = 7.23700 A, c = 6.02600 A, alpha = beta = 90 deg,  gamma = 120 deg.
    * Space group : P 6<sub>3</sub>/mmc
    * (Nominal) horizontal scattering plane : (H,H,L) (u=(1,1,0), v=(0,0,1))

* "scan01_Omega_-88deg.png" is the diffraction pattern measured when the Omega angle was â€“88 deg. (Note that there were only two detector banks when this data was measured.) The nominal orientation of the crystal was shown below.

* Determine the orientation of the crystal using [Neutron Laue DIffraction Pattern Simulator for HRC(BL12)](https://nakajima.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tools/hrc_laue_sim/).
* Once we obtained the correct orientation, we can reproduce diffraction patterns measured other orientations. For example, "scan02_Omega_-60deg.png" is the diffraction pattern measured at omega=-60 deg. Please confirm that this diffraction pattern agrees with the simulation by applying -28 deg rotation about the z axis (= omega axis).

### Problem 2
Find optimum conditions (Chopper, orientation) to measure the magnetic excitations in CsVCl<sub>3</sub> using web apps introduced above.

Preliminary info.
* CsVCl<sub>3</sub> exhibits 1D spin excitation along the (0,0,L) direction. 
* The dispersion relation depends only on the L index.
* The excitation energy at the Brillouin zone boundary is about 70 meV.
* There might be a small energy gap at (0,0,1).
* It would be convenient to simultaneously measure 
    * the whole dispersion relation.
    * a magnified view near (0,0,1) to see if the energy gap exists or not. 

Please make a ppt presentation in each group.
The presentation should contain
1. Chopper frequency.
2. Orientation of the crystal.
3. Accessible Q-E ranges for multiple Ei.
4. Energy resolution and intensity.
