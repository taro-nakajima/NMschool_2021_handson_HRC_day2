### Sec. 1-3: Example of crystal alignment at HRC.
When starting a neutron scattering experiment on a single crystal at HRC, we need to know the orientation of the crystal. We measure a neutron Laue diffraction pattern with a polychromatic neutron beam (without using the Fermi chopper). A typical neutron Laue diffraction pattern is shown below.

This is a diffraction pattern for a tetragonal crystal.
* Lattice constants : a = b = 8.499 A, c = 5.528 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 deg.
* Space group : P-4 21 m
* (Nominal) horizontal scattering plane : (H,0,L)
